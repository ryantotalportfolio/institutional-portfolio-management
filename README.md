# Institutional Portfolio Management & Analytics

This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience with institutional portfolio
management, risk, liquidity, and asset allocation reporting at scale. The analyses
and frameworks documented here are informed by public CalPERS Investment Committee
materials and reflect processes I have worked with directly in a professional capacity.

The goal of this repository is to show how large, multi-asset portfolios are monitored,
analyzed, and communicated to senior leadership and boards — and how modern analytics
and AI-enabled tools can enhance productivity, transparency, and decision support.

## Public Reference Materials

Several frameworks and analyses in this repository are directly informed by publicly
available CalPERS Investment Committee materials, including (but not limited to):

- Investment Committee agenda items covering Total Fund asset allocation,
  risk, liquidity, and portfolio construction
- Total Fund exposure monitoring and policy compliance frameworks
- Liquidity management, rebalancing, and private asset pacing concepts

All work in this repository uses mock or synthesized data and does not contain
confidential, proprietary, or non-public information.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- Deep familiarity with Total Fund portfolio construction and monitoring
- Cross-asset aggregation of portfolio data for executive and board reporting
- Liquidity and pacing concepts supporting private assets
- Performance and risk interpretation across public and private markets
- Use of Python, SQL, Power BI–style modeling, and AI/LLM-assisted workflows
  to improve efficiency and consistency in institutional investment processes
